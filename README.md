# Markrundown

> Runnable markdown documents, with superpowers for technical authors who specialize writing programming tutorials and gitorials. Your book executes the same steps your readers will, including shell commands, writing code, committing to a git repo, and preparing associated distributables (e.g. zipped git repos).

Markrundown allows you to write markdown that takes advantage of your coding skills to make writing a  book less repetitive and more like programming. 

This is good for technical books that must be maintained over time to incorporate ongoing changes of the book's dependencies (e.g. library and API changes).
